# NOUN CHUNKING USING RNN PERCEPTRON

### NOTE
This project is done as a part of course assignment for the course `CS772: Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing` taught by `Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya` at `IIT Bombay`

## Description

The project aims at performing noun chunking in a corpus given its Part of Speech (POS) tags. The task is achieved using RNN Perceptron and Sigmoid models that are implemented from scratch.
 
## Features
-Implemenatation of Recurrent Neural Net Perceptron from scratch performing noun chunking
