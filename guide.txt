THIS IS THE GUIDE TO OUR CODE 

PLEASE CHECK

<mainSigmoid.ipynb> 
<mainPerceptron.ipynb> 

These contain all the implementations

We have Implemented two models


1. SIGMOID RNN 

<mainSigmoid.ipynb> 
has all the code, solutions, implementations and step by step walk-through of all the  parts implemented. This is for the case of Sigmoid RNN

<PRNNSigmoid.py>
has the Sigmoid RNN class and its method

<PRNN_utilsSigmoid.py>
has all the helper functions for Sigmoid RNN 

<sigmoidRNN_backprop1.jpeg> and <sigmoidRNN_backprop1.jpeg>
contained the theoritical derivation of the BPTT for Sigmoid



2. PERCEPTRON RNN 

<mainPerceptron.ipynb> 
has all the code, solutions, implementations and step by step walk-through of all the  parts implemented. This is for the case of Perceptron RNN

<PRNN.py>
has the Perceptron RNN class and its method

<PRNN_utils.py>
has all the helper functions for Perceptron RNN.

<StepPerceptromRNN_backprop1.jpeg> 
contained the theoritical derivation of the BPTT for Sigmoid
